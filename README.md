### Notes
It went reasonably smooth this time. I only have one problem which I wasn't able to figure out, thr grid view. This error pops up in my program and I don't know how to fix it: Thread 1: Exception: "could not dequeue a view of kind: UICollectionElementKindCell with identifier MovieGridCell - must register a nib or a class for the identifier or connect a prototype cell in a storyboard"

### Notes
I came across with a bunch of unexpected error even tho I was following the instructor step by step. Some of the mwere becaue of my computer, such as 'I haven't intalled cocoapods before' this was causeing me error and it took a long time for me to understand that cocoapods was the issue. After I was done with the program the gif recorder which CodePath suggested us to use did not work, for some reason it was not recording anyhting that I was doing on the screen.
