### Notes
I came across with a bunch of unexpected error even tho I was following the instructor step by step. Some of the mwere becaue of my computer, such as 'I haven't intalled cocoapods before' this was causeing me error and it took a long time for me to understand that cocoapods was the issue. After I was done with the program the gif recorder which CodePath suggested us to use did not work, for some reason it was not recording anyhting that I was doing on the screen.
